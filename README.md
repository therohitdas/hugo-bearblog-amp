# Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear Blog - AMPlified!  ‚ö°Ô∏è

üß∏ A fork of the [Hugo Bear Blog theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) with added AMP ‚ö°Ô∏è support. Best for mobile SEO ü§å

## ** üíÄ YOU ARE ON THE ANTI-FEATURES BRANCH üíÄ **

##  Why AMP?

We all know mobile is where it's at these days!  This theme takes the simplicity and speed of the original Bear Blog and gives it an extra boost with AMP, so you can capture all that sweet, sweet mobile SEO traffic. 

## Features

- **AMP Support:**  Get those lightning-fast page load times that Google loves, especially on mobile.
- **`amp-img` Integration:** Images are automatically optimized for AMP with responsive sizing and layout. 
- **`amp-ad` Support:**  Monetize your content with AdSense ads. (See usage below)
- **`amp-analytics` Integration:** Track your traffic with Google Analytics. (See usage below)
- **`amp-iframe` for YouTube Embeds:**  Easily add YouTube videos to your pages while using the privacy-conscious  `youtube-nocookie`  domain. (See usage below)

## Demo

## Installation

If you already have a Hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/therohitdas/hugo-bearblog-amp.git themes/hugo-bearblog-amp
```

Then, adjust the `hugo.toml` as detailed below.

For more information, read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) of Hugo.

## Adjust configuration / hugo.toml

Please check out the [hugo.toml](https://github.com/therohitdas/hugo-bearblog-amp/blob/master/exampleSite/hugo.toml) included in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/therohitdas/hugo-bearblog-amp/tree/master/exampleSite) of this theme.

## Content & structure

### Starting fresh

If you are starting fresh, simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.

#### Page

You can add **a new page** via running

```bash
hugo new my-new-page.md
```

#### Blog-Post

You can add **a new blog-post** via running

```bash
hugo new blog/my-new-post.md
```

### Adding your branding / colors / css

Add a `custom_head.html`-file to your `layouts/partials`-directory. In there you may add a `<style>`-tag, *or* you may add a `<link>`-tag referencing your own `custom.css` (in case you prefer to have a separate `.css`-file). Check out the [`style.html`](https://github.com/therohitdas/hugo-bearblog-amp/blob/master/layouts/partials/style.html)-file to find out which CSS-styles are applied by default.

## Using the AMP Shortcodes

### `adsense` Shortcode

Monetize your content with AdSense ads! 

**Usage:**

```
{{< adsense width="300" height="250" slot="1234567890" layout="responsive" >}} 
```

- Replace `300`, `250`, `1234567890`, and `responsive` with your desired ad dimensions, slot ID, and layout.
- Make sure to set your AdSense Publisher ID in your `hugo.toml`. See example [`hugo.toml`](https://github.com/therohitdas/hugo-bearblog-amp/blob/master/exampleSite/hugo.toml#L58).

### `youtube` Shortcode

Embed YouTube videos easily and with privacy in mind!

**Usage:**

```
{{< youtube D1Yb31r9eY0 >}} 
```

- Replace `D1Yb31r9eY0` with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed.

### `analytics` Shortcode (Optional - Already Included)

You don't need to use a shortcode for Google Analytics. It's already included in the theme! Just make sure to set your Google Analytics Tracking ID in your `hugo.toml`. See example [`hugo.toml`](https://github.com/therohitdas/hugo-bearblog-amp/blob/master/exampleSite/hugo.toml#L62).
